# PrincipalComponentAnalysis

In this .ipynb File i have performed the complete steps for performing the PCA in Iris datset taken from sklearn.datasets
1) Load the dataset
2) Normalize the Data Score using the Z-score scalar
3) Calculate the Covariance Matrix 
4) Sort the eigen Vectors acc. to the eigen values in dec. order , chose the 1st k eigen vectors & that will be the k new Dimensions 
5) Tranform the original N dimension data points to K dimensions
